## Summary

The Mars Colony App was created to be a Single Page Application (SPA) that could be used to register a new colonist on Mars. For this particular project we used Angular 2 and Typescript for the build, and SASS for the basic styling. 

## Languages and Tools Used

  
  - Angular 2
  - JS/TS 
  - CSS/SASS
  - HTML
  - API
  - Node JS
  - Git/Github
  - Postman
  - Webpack
  
  
## Learning Outcomes

This project gave us the chance to delve into concepts of Angular 2 JS and apply them by building this SPA. By developing this project I was able to gain a strong foundation of understanding of the important Angular concepts such as:  components and modules, routing and navigation, classes and interfaces, and last but not least classes, interfaces and decorators that allow for form and API representation.
