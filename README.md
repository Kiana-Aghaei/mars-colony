# Mars Colony 

## Summary

The Mars Colony App was created to be a Single Page Application (SPA) that could be used to register a new colonist on Mars. For this particular project we used Angular 2 and Typescript for the build, and SASS for the basic styling. 

## Languages and Tools Used
  
  * HTML
  * Angular 2 JS/TS
	* CSS/SASS
	* API's
	* Typescript
	* Node JS
	* Git/Github
	* Postman
	* Webpack
  
	

## Learning Outcomes

This project gave us the chance to delve into concepts of Angular 2 JS and apply them by building this SPA. By developing this project I was able to gain a strong foundation of understanding of the important Angular concepts such as:  components and modules, routing and navigation, classes and interfaces, and last but not least classes, interfaces and decorators that allow for form and API representation.
